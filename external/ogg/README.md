## OGG: OpenGeometry Group 

This directory contains sources of Open Geometry Group (OGG), a software
development platform providing services for 3D surface and solid modeling, CAD 
data exchange, and visualization. Most of OGG functionality is available in 
the form of C++ libraries. OGG can be best applied in development of software 
dealing with 3D modeling (CAD), manufacturing / measuring (CAM) or numerical 
simulation (CAE).

OGG was designed as a drop-in replacement of OCCT with more
features,  fewer bugs, and better performance.

**OCCT, which is the base of OGG, is a product  of Matra Datavision Company.**
